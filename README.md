# PartyPlay
A plugin to display generic information about your party's activities within Runescape. 

This plugin essentially leverages Discord plugin design and displays the rich information that would be shown on your Discord Rich Presence status. The main difference here is that the information is only shared with your party members. Within the config, you will find options resembling those of the main Discord plugin.

New features will of course be added, such as more complex & interesting state information. E.g. "Training Slayer, Melee" "159 Kurasks left"
